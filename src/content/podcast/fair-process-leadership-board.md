# Episode Overview

We delve into the transformative concept of Fair Process Leadership (FPL), a management framework that emphasizes fairness in decision-making processes. Unlike distributive justice, which focuses on outcomes, FPL prioritizes procedural justice‚Äîthe "how" of decision-making‚Äîto foster trust, satisfaction, and organizational success. 

Our discussion highlights the five key criteria for a fair process:

- Communication and voice
- Clarity of information, process, and expectations
- Consistency across values and norms
- Changeability based on evidence
- A culture of authenticity

We also explore a six-step decision-making process designed to foster fairness, engagement, and adaptability at every stage.

Real-world examples and case studies, such as Mastercard's CEO succession and Interbrew's acquisition of Bass Brewers, illustrate both the benefits of FPL and the consequences of neglecting it. Additionally, we discuss how decision-making biases and psychological safety impact organizational performance.
