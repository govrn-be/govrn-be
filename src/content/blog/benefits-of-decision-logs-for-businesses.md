Decision logs are an essential tool for businesses and organizations, providing a systematic way to track, document, and analyze decisions. They record key details such as the rationale behind decisions, the people involved, and the outcomes. By offering a clear history of past choices, decision logs enhance accountability, transparency, and organizational learning.

## What is a Decision Log?

A decision log is a centralized document that records decisions made within an organization. It typically includes:  

- **Date of Decision**: When the decision was made.  
- **Decision-Makers**: The individuals or groups involved in making the decision.  
- **Rationale**: The reasons or context behind the decision.  
- **Outcome**: The result or impact of the decision.  

Decision logs can be tailored to meet the needs of specific organizations, often including additional information such as risks, benefits, and stakeholders involved.
